        <strong>Most importants one/strong>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>8 thin slices Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>

<h4 class="head">Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice a small pocket into each chicken breast with a sharp knife. Layer cheese slices, avocado slices, and sliced jalapeno inside the chicken pockets. Pinch chicken breasts closed and secure with toothpicks or skewers; place chicken into a casserole dish</li>

         <li>Whisk olive oil, lime juice, mesquite seasoning, and salt together in a bowl; drizzle half of the mixture over chicken breasts. Turn chicken breasts over and drizzle with remaining olive oil mixture; cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes</li>
            
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            
            <li>chicken breasts on preheated grill and cook for 7 minutes; turn chicken over and brush with BBQ sauce on the cooked side.
                 <br>Continue grilling for about 5 minutes; turn chicken over and apply BBQ sauce to the second cooked side. Cook chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 2 minutes more. 
                 <br>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
