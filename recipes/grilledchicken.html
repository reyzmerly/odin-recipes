 <P>
    The secret to this simple grilled chicken is a very powerful
     marinade and 'roasting' it slowly over semi-indirect heat on the grill.
 </P>
 <h2><em>INGREDIENTS</em></h2>
 <ul>
    <li>6 cloves garlic (or more to taste), crushed or very finely minced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
    <li>½ cup lemon juice</li>
    <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
    <li>6 chicken leg quarters</li>
    <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>STEPS</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Whisk garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, black pepper, lemon juice, olive oil, <br> nd vinegar together in a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Make 2 slashes on the skin side down to the bone in the thigh section and 1 in the leg section of each leg quarter. This will help infuse pieces with marinade and allow faster cooking on the grill.
        <br> Season both sides of chicken generously with kosher salt. 
        <br>Transfer to bowl with marinade and thoroughly coat all sides. Cover and marinate in refrigerator 4 to 12 hours.</li>
    <li>Transfer chicken to paper-towel-lined sheet pan to drain slightly.</li>
    <li>Place leg quarters on grill skin side down over semi-direct heat (avoid intense direct heat so chicken cooks evenly and skin doesn't burn).
        <br> Cook 6 or 7 minutes. Turn chicken and cook another 6 to 7 minutes. 
        <br>Continue cooking and turning until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 8 to 10 more minutes. 
        <br>Serve with lemon wedges.</li>
  </ol>
